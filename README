Here is all the code for analyzing both WLC-type data and peeling-type data.

Tss_force_code : 
    - takes raw data in Sara's form (DNA peeling data) and converts it to force vs. tip-sample-separation data
    - takes RDF files and converts them into tip-sample-separation data.

Peeling_code : 
    - takes peeling-type force-separation data and produces cut-off list of forces (2D -> 1D transform)

Transform_code : 
    - Lc_transform takes tss_force data and converts it using the WLC into Lc values (2D -> 1D transform)
    - Plateau_transform takes tss_force data and finds the last, long plateau as in DNA data and produces a list of those force values only

Density_code :
    - takes any list of values and produces a gaussian kernel density estimate

Coincidence_code :
    - takes any set of KDEs and calculates the coincidence matrix

Cluster_code :
    - takes any list representing a lower triangular coincidence matrix and produces an agglomerative hierarchical cluster
